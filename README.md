This repo holds TruClient scripts created as examples of how to create scripts on real apps.

Scripts are in various folders, one folder for each [UI feature/capability](Features.md). Features.md

Each script name is prefixed by a code for the website being scripted, listed in WebsitesScripted.md. 

What we would like to see in the script, and how to create a script is described in Scripting.md.
