TODO: I am working on a database driven app to manage details on this page, and generating these pages.

Names of elements may be my invention, since each framework may have a different name for the same feature.

## <a name="Alphabetically"></a> UI Elements Listed Alphabetical:

Github naturally sorts folders in the repository in alphabetical order.
To avoid yanking your chain with empty folders, each of the 43 folders below
is created only when there is a script that goes in it.
