Github naturally sorts folders in alphabetical order.
To avoid yanking your chain with empty folders, each of the 43 folders below
is created only when there is a script that goes in it.

Names of elements may be my invention, since each framework may have a different name for the same feature.

The table below is copied from a spreadsheet.
