In the repo scripts are stored within folders.
There is one folder for each UI feature
to group scripts dealing with the same feature together.

To avoid yanking your chain with empty folders, each of the 88 folders/features identified 
is created only when there is a script that goes in it.

Each framework may have a different name for the same feature,
so I may have taken liberties with the names of folders/features.

Github naturally sorts folders in alphabetical order, so that's how they are presented here.

The table below is copied from an Excel spreadsheet for easier sorting.

The **Type** values are:

 * **Mobile** - capabilties only avaialable in mobile smart phones.
 * **Widget** - a UI control that bring the richness of desktop applications to the Web.

TIH1 and other columns are described in [WebsitesToScript.md](WebsitesToScript.md).
